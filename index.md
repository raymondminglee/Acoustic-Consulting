# NEST+m Auditorium Consulting

---

## Introdution
NEST+m is a local k-12 public school located in the lower east side of Manhattan, New York. They approch to us, the Cooper Union Acouistic and Vibration Laboratory for help
because of their auditorium's bad acoustical environment. The school's auditorium is fan-shaped witha volumn of about 529 seats. The school is concenred due to auditorium's high reverberation time(echoness) and low intelligibility. 
<br><br>
This project seeks a low-cost solution for reducing the reverberation time while also engaging the
schoolsâ€™ students in a creative and interactive project. My teammate and I offered the school a proposed solution based on our meaurement during the site visit. The proposed solution was backed up using CATT Acoutsic modeling.
After NEST+m acceptted our proposal, we did another measurement to see if the expected improvment is accomplished. 
<br><br>

## Initial Site-Visit
### Criteria
*__Reverberation Time__*
<br>
Reverberation time describes how long sound energy stays in a given space. It is often precived as echoness of the space. 
<br><br>
Upon our first visit, we took RT measurement using interrupted method, by excitingh the room with enough sound energy and measure the decay time. The foloowing plot shows our measured RT of the auditorium

<br>
It is clear that the RT is too __high__ for an auditorium.

## Recommandation and Prediction
We aim to find a low-cost solution to bring down the RT of the auditorium, so we proposed acoustic panels for the school.
We use Sabine's formula to caculate what would the expected RT be with acoustic panel.

The school eventualy selected our proposal of using 12 4'\*8' Knauf panel convering 384 ft^2 with only about $4000 on cost
